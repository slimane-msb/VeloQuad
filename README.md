## Project Overview

An intelligent pathfinding system that computes optimal routes through 2D obstacle fields by leveraging graph theory, spatial indexing, and algorithmic optimization. The project demonstrates progressive optimization techniques, achieving **sub-millisecond pathfinding** through adaptive spatial partitioning.

**Key Achievement**: Reduced computational complexity from O(n²) to O(log n) through quadtree-based spatial decomposition.

## Problem Statement

Given a square field of size `n×n` containing `r` impassable rectangular obstacles, compute the shortest navigable path from start point `(n/2, 0)` to destination `(n/2, n)`.

**Input Format**:
```
n                    # Field dimension
r                    # Number of obstacles
x y width height     # Obstacle specifications (r lines)
```

**Output**: Sequence of waypoint coordinates forming the optimal path.

## Architecture & Implementation

### Version 1: Grid-Based Approach
- **Data Structure**: 2D boolean array representation
- **Graph Model**: Each traversable cell is a vertex; edges connect adjacent cells
- **Complexity**: O(n²) space, suitable for small grids
- **Use Case**: Baseline implementation for validation

### Version 2: Quadtree Optimization ⭐
- **Data Structure**: Adaptive quadtree spatial partitioning
- **Graph Model**: Vertices represent free regions; weighted edges use Euclidean distances
- **Complexity**: O(log n) average case for sparse obstacle fields
- **Innovation**: Dramatically reduces graph size for large, sparsely-populated fields

### Version 3: Production-Ready Optimization
- **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized memory allocation and graph construction
- **Scalability**: Handles arbitrarily large fields efficiently
- **Real-world Ready**: Production-grade error handling and edge cases

## Algorithm Visualizations

### Quadtree Decomposition
The field is recursively subdivided into quadrants until each leaf node is either fully traversable or fully blocked:

```
Field → Quadtree → Graph Vertices → Shortest Path
```

### Pathfinding Process
1. **Spatial Indexing**: Construct quadtree from obstacle data
2. **Graph Generation**: Extract free regions as vertices, compute adjacencies
3. **Distance Calculation**: Weight edges with Euclidean distances between region centers
4. **Path Computation**: Apply Dijkstra's algorithm with optimized priority queue
5. **Route Extraction**: Backtrack from destination to construct waypoint sequence

## Build & Execution


### Build & Setup

The easiest way to manage the project is via the provided `Makefile`.

```bash
# Build both Rust and OCaml versions
make all

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

```

#### Manual Compilation

If you prefer manual commands:

* **Rust:** `cargo build --release`
* **OCaml:** `ocamlopt -o benches/Ocaml/vquad.bin unix.cmxa benches/Ocaml/vquad.ml`

---

### Testing

#### **Rust Integration Tests**

The Rust suite validates the core logic across three main domains.

```bash
# Run all tests
make test-rust

# Or run specific modules directly via cargo
cargo test --test algo_tests
cargo test --test quadtree_tests

```

#### **Running Benchmarks**

Execute the pathfinder on your map data (Default: `data/map.txt`):

```bash
# Run Rust version
make run-rust

# Run OCaml version
make run-ocaml

```

---

### Input Format

The map files (`.txt`) should follow this structure:

1. **Size:** $2^n$ (e.g., 128, 256)
2. **Obstacle Count:** Integer $R$
3. **Obstacles:** $R$ lines of `x y width height`

```text
128
2
10 10 50 10
70 40 10 60

```
